<br/>
<br/>

The Hope Foundation is a registered charity working with street and slum children in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), India.
Hope foundation was established in the year 1980 with the agenda to help the homeless and physically challenged children and the elderly. It also extends its support to women who want to pursue an independent career. 
</br>
<p>
We work to free children and poor families from lives of pain, abuse, poverty and darkness.
Living on the streets, children are exposed to horrendous abuse. Those who survive are left to fend for themselves, with no promise of a safe future. They are forced to work from as young as five years of age to earn money for food and so cannot go to school. HOPE works to free them from child labour. HOPE funds and operates over 60 projects.
